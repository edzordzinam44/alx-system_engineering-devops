## Web stack debugging #2
## General
	Web stack debugging is a critical process in the realm of web development, encompassing the investigation and resolution of issues that arise within the various layers of a web application's architecture. It involves tracing and diagnosing problems that may occur in the frontend user interface, backend server logic, and the interactions between different components such as databases, APIs, and frameworks. Effective debugging requires a combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and the utilization of debugging tools and techniques like logging, breakpoints, and error tracking systems. By meticulously dissecting issues at each layer of the web stack, developers can identify root causes and implement solutions, ensuring the smooth operation and functionality of web applications.
